<p class="bom">Shropshire Cat Rescue launched an urgent appeal for donations this week after it had seen an influx of kittens being brought into its care.

Charity volunteers set up a Just Giving page and shared the link on social media to appeal for support from people who were in a position to donate.

With an initial target of £500, to cover some of the costs of health checks, vaccinations, feeding etc, the charity has so far received £3,184 and counting.

Susie Phillips, online shop and shelter volunteer said: "The support means a lot to the volunteers and we are truly grateful and amazed by the response from our Facebook post appealing for help.

"It has been a busy week full of highs and lows and having this support really does help.</p>
